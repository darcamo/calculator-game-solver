# Calculator Game Solver

Solver for the levels in the [Calculator Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sm.calculateme).

This was created just for fun and to test a few things.

In order to use it, modify the code inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` part
in the `solver.py` file and then execute the file.
